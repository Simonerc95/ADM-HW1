# ADM-HW1

The repository contains all the scripts for the Hacker-Rank challenges in the file ['Scripts.py'](https://github.com/Simonerc95/ADM-HW1/blob/master/Scripts.py), and the folder ['Stamps'](https://github.com/Simonerc95/ADM-HW1/tree/master/Stamps), with screenshots of all the submissions.
The order in which challenges were submitted is not the same of the homework assignment, but in the 'Scripts.py' file i have put the challenges in the same order of the assignment, so the scripts for Problem 1 are all placed before the ones of Problem 2, and sections in Problem 1 follow the order of sections in the assignment.
